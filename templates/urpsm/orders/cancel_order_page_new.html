BILLING AND REFUND POLICIES
A shop owner can cancel an Unlocking API service order if he did not receive his product in the concluded time limit. A Shop owner has the plain right to receive a refund of the amount of his order minus 2% of the amount. If the shop owner judges the code given by the server owner as wrong, the server owner must resend a correct code. The shop owner must send a video recording showing the testing of the code on the phone to unlock to prove that the code is wrong. The video should show the result of the display of the command *#06# which is the IMEI of the phone, all this in high quality recording. The Unlocking server API is also urged to present a proof that the provided code is fully functioning and/or why the shop owner failed to unlock his device. If the shop owner don’t receive his correct code, the administration must intervene to find a middle solution cancel the order and refund the shop owner. If any review from a client contains an insult or bashing, the shop owner and server owner have the plain
right asking the administration to delete the inappropriate content by reporting abuse. Note that the following is applicable; URPSM fees are 5% of each transaction.
- In the case of a refund, the shop owner can ask refund withing 24h start from order delivery time
- In the case of a refund, URPSM keeps 2% of the previous described fees
- If the shop owner incidentally sends a wrong IMEI to the server API, no refund is to compensate.
- If the service provider didn't answer to a cancellation process withing 3 days , the shop owner will be refunded ans service provider can't ask any return
- If both side didn't find a solution they can ask admin-support to judge ( this case need evidence from both side).
