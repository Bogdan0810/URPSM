Transfer of Information</span></p><p><span>We may disclose your personal information to third parties in a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) take action regarding suspected illegal activities; (b) enforce or apply our Terms of Service and Privacy and Security Policy; (c) comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order; or (d) protect our rights, reputation, and property, or that of our Users, affiliates, or the public. Please note that we are not required to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena, or other similar governmental request that we receive.</span></p><p><span>We may disclose information in the aggregate to third parties relating to User behavior in connection with actual or prospective business relationships with those third parties, such as advertisers and content distributors. For example, we may disclose the number of Users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, advertising banners.</span></p><p><span class="bold-text">3. Others&#39; Information</span></p><p><span>You may choose to provide us with another person&#39;s e-mail address so that person may be invited to create an account on the URPSM Site. We use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind that person about the invitation. By providing us with another person&#39;s e-mail address, you represent to us that you have obtained the consent of the person concerned as regards such disclosure to us of their personal information. All invitees are provided with the option not to receive further invitations. We may disclose such information if required to do so in order to comply with legal process, as described above.</span></p><p><span class="bold-text">4. Links</span></p><p><span>The URPSM Site may contain links to third party sites to provide additional, value added services. Except as set forth herein, we do not share your personal information with those third parties, and are not responsible for their privacy practices. We suggest you read the privacy policies on all such third party websites.</span></p><p><span class="bold-text">5. Controlling Your Personal Data</span></p><p><span>To the extent you include personal information in your public submissions, such as a photo of yourself, third parties may be able to identify you, associate you with your user account, and contact you. Please do not include information in your public submissions that you expect to keep private.</span></p><p><span>Please also note that the private messages you send or receive using the URPSM Site, and/or the Private Content contained generally within your project workspaces, are only private to the extent that you, the sender/recipient, and/or all project participants with access to the information keep such information private. For example, we do not have any control over whether a recipient of one of your private messages or a project participant publicly posts such information.</span></p><p><span class="bold-text">6. Security</span></p><p><span>Your account is password protected. We use industry leading measures, including site wide secure sockets layer protocols to protect the Private Content, the project workspace information, and personal information that is stored in our database or sent using the URPSM Site. We limit the access to your personal information to those employees and contractors who need access to perform their job function, such as our customer service personnel. If you have any questions about the security on the URPSM Site, please contact us. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that your personal information will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy and Security Policy.</span></p><p><span>You hereby acknowledge that URPSM is not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner.</span></p><p><span class="bold-text">7. Confidential Information</span></p><p><span>We take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that Private Content and any information shared in a private project workspace remains private and confidential between the project participants. We intend for confidential communications that are traditionally protected under a legally recognized privilege, such as attorney- client, doctor-patient, or psychotherapist-patient privileges, to be protected when those communications take place in a private project workspace. Privileged and confidential information that is intercepted in an unauthorized or unlawful manner should continue to be privileged and confidential. However, information shared between project participants in a project workspace may not be considered privileged and confidential if you or other project participants with access to the information make such information public or available to others. Information communicated by you in public submissions is not considered private and is most likely not protected by any of the aforementioned privileges.</span></p><p><span>On occasion, our employees or other companies hired by us may need to access information in your private project workspaces to perform certain services related to customer support or site maintenance. Those employees or other companies are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. Such access should not impact any privileges related to the information.</span></p><p><span class="bold-text">8. E-mails and Opt-out</span></p><p><span>You may opt-out of receiving e-mails from URPSM. Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you notices of any updates to our Terms of Service or Privacy and Security Policy.</span></p><p><span class="bold-text">9. Terms and Modifications to this Privacy Policy</span></p><p><span>We may modify this Privacy and Security Policy at any time, and we will post any new versions on this page. If we make any material changes in the way we use your personal information, we will notify you by sending an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on the URPSM Site. Any such changes will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on the URPSM Site. These changes will be effective immediately for new Users of the URPSM Site. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this Section will not apply to license or subscription agreements between URPSM and its paying customers and any modifications to signed contracts between URPSM and paying Users will require written agreement and acceptance by all parties to the contract. Please note that at all times you are responsible for updating your personal information to provide us with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice. In any event, changes to this Privacy and Security Policy may affect our use of personal information that you provided us prior to our notification to you of the changes. If you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your personal information, you must notify us prior to the effective date of the changes that you wish to deactivate your account with us. Continued use of the URPSM Site following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.</span></p><p><span class="bold-text">10.
